I have completed M.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from Jahangirnagar University.During my graduation participated at different national/Intra-university programming contest. I started my professional career as a Software Engineer at The "Solution world Limited".Now I am working as a software engineer(Team Lead) at AmazingSoft.

Having 4.3+- years of experience in software engineering and 1.3+ years of team leading experience, worked on different platforms and languages and played different roles like Sr. Software Engineer, Lead and Engineering Manager.

I consider myself a Backend Engineer, mostly worked on Backend.

 I'm flexible, proactive, and curious. I believe in the craft of software engineering, but are pragmatic and are driven to make a positive change in the world. I love tackling challenges and I enjoy writing about it, I learned what it means to be a leader and a team player and thanks to that experience I am fueled with a desire to succeed and scale new heights and challenges to where my mindset is not : ‚Äúcan we do this?‚Äù But ‚Äúwhat have we not scaled yet?‚Äù.

I‚Äôm a straightforward and open-minded, To me, honesty, humanity, and ethics are more important than being religious.
